"""landscape-change-detection-pipeline: satellite-based land-cover
classification and change detection pipeline (tiling, download,
classification, change detection).

Import ordering workaround (Windows)
-------------------------------------
Several modules in this package import both a GDAL/rasterio-family package and, indirectly through
pandas, pyarrow's parquet engine. On Windows, conda-forge's GDAL/rasterio and
pip's pyarrow wheel both ship their own copies of several shared DLLs;
whichever loads first wins the process-wide DLL search order. If rasterio
loads first, pyarrow's own native extensions can fail later with an
``ImportError`` ("DLL load failed") the first time any code calls
``pandas.DataFrame.to_parquet``/``read_parquet`` -- even though pyarrow
imports fine on its own, and even though nothing in the failing call touches
rasterio at all. Importing pyarrow's parquet engine here, before this
package's own submodules get a chance to import rasterio, fixes the DLL
search order for every entry point (``scripts/*.py``, tests) that imports
``landscape_change_detection_pipeline`` first, regardless of which of its submodules
happens to import rasterio.
