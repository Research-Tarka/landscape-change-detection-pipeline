"""Google Earth Engine authentication with fail-fast, actionable errors.

Purpose
-------
Initialize the Earth Engine client, and fail immediately with an instructive
message when credentials or a project id are missing -- rather than hanging,
or failing much later inside a scene search/download loop.

Inputs
------
- A GEE project id, from (in order): the explicit argument, the ``EE_PROJECT``
  environment variable / ``.env``, or ``config.gee.project``.
- Earth Engine credentials, from the standard credential store created by
  ``earthengine authenticate`` (this project's primary path: it uses the
  user's personal GEE account, not a service account), or a service-account
  key file for unattended runs.

Outputs
-------
- An initialized ``ee`` module, or :class:`GeeAuthError`.

Why fail fast
-------------
Scene search/download cannot run without credentials, and a partially
authenticated client produces confusing errors deep inside per-scene calls.
:func:`initialize_ee` therefore validates the project id up front, then
performs a **round-trip call** (``ee.Number(1).add(1).getInfo()``) with a
timeout so a misconfigured or unauthorized project surfaces here, at startup,
with a message naming the fix. This guards against a hung network call
blocking indefinitely without the timeout.
